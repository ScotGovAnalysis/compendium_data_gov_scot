# R Markdown

## About R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

# Features

## Plots

You can embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Mathematics (MathJax)

This template uses MathJax to render mathematical notation in-browser.

Use dollar signs as your delimiter for maths. A single dollar sign renders your maths inline.

$c^2 = a^2 + b^2$

Two dollar signs center-aligns your maths.

$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$

Complex mathematics is supported, too.

$$\mathbf{P}((X,Y) \in B) = \iint\limits_{(x,y) \in B} f_{X,Y}(x,y) \,dx \,dy$$

## DataTables

Support for [DataTables](https://www.datatables.net/) is included. DataTables allows for the creation of advanced tables with greater user interaction.

```{r kable, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  x = iris,
  format = "html",
  caption = "An example table, generated using the Kable library.",
  caption.short = "A short caption."
)
```
